![AGRISENSE](https://github.com/benny-png/BUNI-HUB-IOT-BASED-AGRO-CHATBOT-PROJECT/raw/main/AGRISENSE.png)

## Overview

AGRISENSE is an intelligent IoT-based farming assistant that leverages sensor data and AI to provide farmers with actionable insights and recommendations. The system collects real-time data from various sensors, processes this data using OpenAI's GPT-4, and sends recommendations to farmers via SMS. The platform supports both English and Kiswahili languages.
